# OpenGLRenderer
Basic OpenGL renderer written in several languages.

I intend to do every language listed in Build_Linux.txt but this is a very boring thing to work on so it may take quite some time.
Current code is a bit ugly in some spots but I decided to upload it anyway since I think my hard drive is going to die soon.
